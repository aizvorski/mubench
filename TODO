- make webpages from output files: summary, and one page per instruction with instruction pairs detail
- more regular (non-simd) x86 instructions
- automatic execution unit detection
- configurable path to temp file (test.c)
- better choice of imm8 constants
- more commands with mixed operands
- fix one-operand or mixed operand latency
- memory operands
- fp math/x87 instructions

old/done:
* xml output
* output containing cpuinfo, gcc version, binutils, etc
* output hash/signature for auto-verification
* instruction pair throughput
* 3dnow requires femms => no
* one-operand instructions
* configurable path to gcc and as
* configurable gcc options
