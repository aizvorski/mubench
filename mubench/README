perl mubench.pl [options]

Options:
 --accurate                accurate looks runs tests several times
 --mhz=2766                speed in MHz (normally autodetected from /proc/cpuinfo, set here if that is wrong)
 --only=and,or             benchmark only instructions mathing those specified


== Output ==

instruction     latency throughput
----------------------------------
paddb xmm, xmm  1.0038  0.50349

all in clock cycles.

Latency=2 means it takes two clock cycles for the result to be available, throughput=2 means a new instruction of the same kind can only be started once every two clock cycles.  Note that smaller latency *and smaller throughput* are faster.  Many instructions have throughput < 1, meaning more than one of the same instruction can run in the same clock cycle.  The same instruction with different operands may have different performance.

Run this benchmark on an otherwise idle system (or as close as possible to idle: the benchmark will try to compensate for occasional cpu usage).


== Requires ==

Perl modules: IPC::Run.
Recent versions of gcc and binutils (gcc >= 3.3, binutils >= 2.16.92 for SSSE3/MNI support)


== Files ==

Creates test.c and test in the current working directory.

Tries to read /proc/cpuinfo on startup.
